Microorganisms are microscopic living organisms including bacteria, fungi, protozoa, algae, and viruses (at the boundary of living/non-living).

Useful Roles: Bacteria like Lactobacillus convert milk to curd; yeast ferments sugars; antibiotics like penicillin originate from fungi; Rhizobium fixes nitrogen in legume root nodules, enriching soil.

Harmful Effects: Pathogens cause diseases like tuberculosis, cholera, malaria (protozoan), influenza (virus). Food spoilage occurs due to microbial growth.

Prevention: Hygiene, clean water, sanitation, vaccination, and vector control reduce disease spread. Preservation methods include refrigeration, dehydration, salting, sugaring, oil layers, pasteurization, preservatives, and canning.

Nitrogen Cycle: Atmospheric nitrogen is fixed by bacteria/lightning; plants assimilate; animals consume; decomposition releases ammonium; nitrification and denitrification complete the cycle.

Examples: Pasteurization heats milk to 72Â°C for 15 seconds then rapid cooling to kill harmful microbes.
