# Microorganisms: Friend and Foe

Learning Objectives
- Classify microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, protozoa, algae, viruses)
- Explain useful roles: nitrogen fixation, decomposition, food production
- Describe diseases and prevention (hygiene, vaccination)
- Understand food preservation methods
- Explain nitrogen cycle overview

Concept Map
- Microbes → Useful (curd, antibiotics, nitrogen fixation) | Harmful (diseases, spoilage) → Prevention (hygiene, preservatives, pasteurization)

Summary
Microorganisms are ubiquitous and can be beneficial or harmful. They drive nutrient cycles, help produce foods and medicines, but can also cause diseases and spoil food. Prevention and preservation techniques reduce harm.
