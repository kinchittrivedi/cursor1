1) Seed Germination Investigation
- Question: How does sowing depth affect germination?
- Method: Sow seeds at 1 cm, 3 cm, 5 cm depths in identical trays. Record germination % and time.
- Safety: Use clean tools, avoid contamination. Handle blades carefully.

2) Irrigation Method Comparison
- Question: Which method conserves more water: surface vs. drip (simulation)?
- Method: Use perforated bottles to simulate drip; measure water used to moisten equal soil volumes.
- Safety: Prevent spills; dry electrical areas.

3) Weed Competition Study
- Question: Do weeds reduce crop seedling growth?
- Method: Grow one pot with seedling only and one with added fast-growing weeds; compare height and biomass.
- Safety: Wash hands after handling soil; dispose of weeds properly.
