Crop Production and Management involves systematic steps to raise crops efficiently.

1) Preparation of Soil: Tilling/Ploughing loosens the soil, improves air circulation, and facilitates root growth. Leveling reduces soil erosion and aids uniform irrigation.

2) Sowing: Quality seeds are selected and sown at proper depth and spacing. Traditional seed drills and modern seed-cum-fertilizer drills ensure even distribution.

3) Adding Manure and Fertilizers: Manure enhances soil structure and microbial activity; fertilizers supply specific nutrients (N, P, K). Overuse can harm soil and water bodies.

4) Irrigation: Sources include canals, wells, tubewells, and rivers. Methods range from traditional surface flow to modern drip and sprinkler, improving water-use efficiency.

5) Protection from Weeds: Weeds compete for nutrients and water. Control methods: manual weeding, tillage, mulching, and selective herbicides. Safety: follow label, protective gear, and avoid drift.

6) Harvesting and Storage: Harvest at physiological maturity. Threshing separates grain, winnowing cleans. Dry to safe moisture, store in airtight, pest-proof structures.

Kharif vs. Rabi: Kharif are monsoon crops (paddy, maize), sown with onset of rains. Rabi are winter crops (wheat, gram).

Crop Rotation and Mixed Cropping: Rotating cereals with legumes restores soil nitrogen and disrupts pest cycles. Mixed cropping diversifies risk.

Animal Husbandry: Dairy, poultry, fisheries provide nutrition and income. Balanced feed, disease control, and hygiene are essential.

Examples: A farmer switches to drip irrigation in sandy soils to save water; a wheat-gram rotation improves yield and reduces fertilizer needs.
